Date parsing in Python is quite slow, especially for large arrays.
Here's a benchmark of various approaches.

$ python date-parse.py
to_datetime: 5799 ms
dateutil:    5162 ms
strptime:    1651 ms
manual:       242 ms
lookup:        32 ms

Manual string-array-based parsing of dates is significantly faster.
Since there aren't many dates, lookups are *MUCH* faster.
